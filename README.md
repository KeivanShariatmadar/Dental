## overview
### 1) short term project for 3D stl auto slicing
### 2) 3D STL file is sliced and saved as png file automatically
 - Result

### 3) auto matching of two 3D models
 - Just an attempt & idea
 - Needed to match patient's 3D scanned mouth cavity to artificially designed bony component
 - Need some calculator that can return value of difference (distance of each points in same height can be difference, for example) between two 3D models
 - Need machine learning that can adjust the way of one model's movement to fit another, which can minimize the value calculated previously
